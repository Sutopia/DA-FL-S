You can make your own skin pack by simply replacing the sprites in the graphic/da folder with your own, and renaming both the "id" and the "name" in mod_info.json. 

Please note that:

You MUST respect the template
"Diable Addon -" + name of your pack to properly overwrite the default skins.

You don't have to replace every single sprite, the others will default to the original ones.
